# Django Examples

This repository is built in order to track some of my personal examples.

The main goal is to store some usual or advanced usage of Django.

Each directory should have an example with documentation.

If you have any module with basic usage and you want to contribute, you will be welcome.


# List of examples

Here you are current examples, in complexity order:

- [todolist]: Basic "To Do List" with pagination generic forms and generic views. Uses [Bootstrap].


# MIT License

Each example may have its own license. If any of them has no one, MIT will be applied:
